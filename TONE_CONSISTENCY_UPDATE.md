# Tone Consistency Update (v3.2.1)

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Same Tone Across All Three Responses

**Before:** Three responses had different tone levels (playful, thoughtful, bold)
**After:** All three responses match the user's selected flirt level

---

## How It Works Now

### User Selects ONE Tone
The user pre-selects their desired tone:
- **Respectful** - Polite, friendly, subtle interest
- **Flirty** - Playful, charming, confidently flirtatious  
- **Bold** - Direct, daring, unapologetically confident

### Three Variations WITHIN That Tone

All responses stay in the same tone but offer different approaches:

1. **Question-based** - Asks something engaging
2. **Statement** - Makes an observation or comment
3. **Action/Suggestion** - Proposes something or suggests next steps

**Category Names Changed:**
- Old: `playful`, `thoughtful`, `bold` (mixed tones)
- New: `question`, `statement`, `action` (same tone, different styles)

## Examples

### Respectful Tone (All 3 Respectful)

**Screenshot:** Dating profile with hiking photos

1. **Question**: "Your hiking photos are amazing! What's been your favorite trail so far?"
2. **Statement**: "I love that you're adventurous. Those mountain views look incredible."
3. **Action**: "I'd love to hear more about your hiking adventures over coffee sometime."

**Notice:** All three are polite, genuine, and respectful. No flirty innuendo.

---

### Flirty Tone (All 3 Flirty)

**Screenshot:** Same hiking photos

1. **Question**: "Okay but who's taking you on these adventures, and how do I apply? üèîÔ∏è"
2. **Statement**: "You're either a professional hiker or really good at making it look effortless."
3. **Action**: "Take me on your next hike and I'll bring the snacks. Deal?"

**Notice:** All three are playful, charming, and confidently flirtatious. Consistent energy.

---

### Bold Tone (All 3 Bold)

**Screenshot:** Same hiking photos

1. **Question**: "When are you taking me hiking? I look good in activewear just saying"
2. **Statement**: "Those mountains don't look half as impressive as you do climbing them."
3. **Action**: "Let's skip the small talk and plan our first adventure this weekend."

**Notice:** All three are direct, forward, and confident. Same bold energy throughout.

3. A: "I'd love to swap book recommendations with you sometime."

#### User Selects: Flirty
1. Q: "A coffee and book person? Do you accept applications for reading buddies? üìö"
2. S: "You've got great taste in books and vibes, I can already tell."
3. A: "Meet me at that coffee shop this week, we can compare notes."

#### User Selects: Bold
1. Q: "How long until you invite me to that coffee shop?"
2. S: "Everything about this energy is exactly what I want."
3. A: "Cancel your plans. Coffee date with me instead, this weekend."

## Technical Details

### Prompt Updates

#### System Prompt (Key Addition)
```
- ALL THREE responses must match the SAME tone level specified by the user
- Each response should offer a different angle or approach WITHIN that tone
- Vary the style: one question-based, one statement-based, one action-oriented
- CONSISTENT with the specified flirt level

What to Avoid:
- Mixing different tone levels across the three responses
```

#### User Prompt (Key Addition)
```
3. Generate three distinct response options that:
   - ALL match the {FLIRT_LEVEL} tone consistently
   - Feel natural for a {AGE}-year-old {GENDER}
   - Offer different angles WITHIN the same tone:
     * Option 1: Question-based approach
     * Option 2: Statement or observation
     * Option 3: Action or suggestion

IMPORTANT: All three responses MUST maintain the {FLIRT_LEVEL} tone. 
Do NOT vary between respectful, flirty, and bold - stick to the 
specified tone for all three options.
```

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I want to see different tones?
**A:** In the future, users will be able to change their tone preference in settings. For now, change the `flirtLevel` in the code.

### Q: Can I get a mix of tones?
**A:** No, by design. The user selects ONE tone and all responses match it. This is more authentic and user-friendly.

### Q: What if none of the three fit?
**A:** Take another screenshot or wait for future updates where you can regenerate responses.

### Q: How do I know which category to pick?
**A:** 
- **Question** - Start a conversation, show curiosity
- **Statement** - Make an impression, show confidence
- **Action** - Move things forward, suggest next step
