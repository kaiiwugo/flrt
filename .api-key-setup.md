# API Key Setup - Local Only

## ✅ Git is Now Configured to Ignore Your API Key

I've run: `git update-index --assume-unchanged flrt/Info.plist`

This means:
- ✅ You can safely add your API key to `flrt/Info.plist` locally
- ✅ Git will **not** track changes to this file
- ✅ You won't accidentally commit your API key again
- ✅ The file will stay with the placeholder in the repo

---

## 🔑 Add Your API Key Safely

1. Open `flrt/Info.plist`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key
3. Save the file
4. **Git will ignore this change** - you're safe!

```xml
<key>OPENAI_API_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE</string>  <!-- This stays local only -->
```

---

## 🛡️ What This Means

### ✅ Safe to Do:
- Edit Info.plist locally with your real API key
- Build and run the app
- The app will work with your key
- Git commits won't include your key

### ⚠️ If You Need to Update Info.plist Structure:
If you need to add NEW keys to Info.plist (not just change the API key value):

1. **First**, remove the ignore flag:
   ```bash
   git update-index --no-assume-unchanged flrt/Info.plist
   ```

2. **Replace your API key** with `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

3. **Make your changes** to the file structure

4. **Commit** the changes

5. **Re-enable the ignore**:
   ```bash
   git update-index --assume-unchanged flrt/Info.plist
   ```

6. **Add your key back** locally

## 🔄 If You Switch Machines

On a new machine:
1. Clone the repo
2. Add your API key to `flrt/Info.plist`
3. Run: `git update-index --assume-unchanged flrt/Info.plist`

---

## 📝 Notes

- This setting is **per-repository, per-machine**
- Your API key stays on your machine only
- Other developers must add their own keys
- The repo always has the placeholder

---

## 🚨 Security Reminder

**You've already exposed your API key twice!**

1. **Revoke the exposed key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Find: `sk-proj-NMFYxBEk...`
   - Click "Revoke"

2. **Generate a new key**

3. **Add the new key** to your local Info.plist

The old key is in git history and should be considered compromised.

## ✅ You're Now Protected

Git will no longer track your local API key changes. You can work safely! 🎉
