# Context Awareness Update (v3.3)

## Problem Identified

The AI wasn't properly understanding:
1. **Which messages were sent BY the user** (their own messages)
2. **Which messages were sent TO the user** (what they're responding to)
3. **The user's conversational perspective and voice**

This resulted in responses that sometimes:
- Didn't address what the other person actually said
- Broke conversational flow
- Missed context clues from the user's previous messages

---

## Solution: Explicit Context Analysis Framework

### Added to System Prompt

#### 1. Critical Analysis Steps
```
1. IDENTIFY MESSAGE OWNERSHIP:
   - Blue/right-aligned bubbles = Messages FROM the user
   - Gray/left-aligned bubbles = Messages TO the user  
   - Green bubbles (iMessage) = Usually the user's messages
   - White/gray bubbles = Usually the other person's messages

2. UNDERSTAND CONVERSATION FLOW:
   - What did the OTHER PERSON just say? (What you're responding to)
   - What has the USER already said? (Context for response style)
   - Conversational momentum and energy
   - Conversation stage (early, mid, deep)

3. ANALYZE CONTEXT:
   - Last message TO the user (needs response)
   - User's established voice, style, interests
   - Questions asked, topics raised, emotional tone
   - Opportunities to advance conversation
```

#### 2. Enhanced Response Guidelines
```
- Responses should flow naturally from what the OTHER PERSON just said
- Match the energy, pace, and style the user has already established
- Do NOT respond to the user's OWN messages
```

### Added to User Prompt

#### Step-by-Step Analysis Framework
```
STEP 1 - IDENTIFY WHO SAID WHAT:
- Blue/right bubbles OR green iMessage bubbles = USER's messages
- Gray/left bubbles OR white bubbles = OTHER PERSON's messages

STEP 2 - FIND THE LAST MESSAGE TO RESPOND TO:
- What is the LAST message from the OTHER PERSON?
- This is what your response should address
- Do NOT respond to user's own messages

STEP 3 - UNDERSTAND THE USER'S VOICE:
- Review what the USER has already said
- Match their texting style, length, energy
- Stay consistent with their communication

STEP 4 - GENERATE RESPONSES:
- Directly respond to what the OTHER PERSON just said
- Match user's established style
- Stay in the specified tone
```

## Examples

### Before (Poor Context Awareness)

**Screenshot:** 
- Gray bubble: "What are you up to this weekend?"
- Blue bubble: "Nothing much, you?"
- Gray bubble: "Thinking of going hiking"

**Old Response (WRONG):**
- "Hiking sounds fun!" *(responds to context, not the actual last message)*

### After (Good Context Awareness)

**Screenshot:** 
- Gray bubble (OTHER): "What are you up to this weekend?"
- Blue bubble (USER): "Nothing much, you?"
- Gray bubble (OTHER): "Thinking of going hiking"

**New Response (CORRECT):**
1. Q: "Where are you thinking? I might be down to join"
2. S: "That actually sounds perfect, I've been meaning to get outside"
3. A: "Let's make it happen, send me the details"

**Why it's better:**
- âœ… Responds to "Thinking of going hiking" (the OTHER PERSON's last message)
- âœ… Matches the casual, interested energy the USER established
- âœ… Advances the conversation naturally

## Visual Cues the AI Now Recognizes

### iMessage/SMS Conversations

**User's Messages:**
- Blue bubbles (iMessage)
- Green bubbles (SMS)
- Right-aligned
- Sent timestamps

**Other Person's Messages:**
- Gray bubbles
- White bubbles (some apps)
- Left-aligned
- Received timestamps

### Dating Apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge)

**User's Messages:**
- Typically right-aligned
- Different color (varies by app)
- May have "Sent" indicator

**Other Person's Messages:**
- Typically left-aligned
- Different color/style
- May have their profile picture

### Instagram/Snapchat DMs

**User's Messages:**
- Right side
- Different styling

**Other Person's Messages:**
- Left side
- Profile picture visible

## What This Fixes

### Problem 1: Responding to Wrong Message

**Before:**
Screenshot shows:
1. Gray: "I love your dog!"
2. Blue: "Thanks! His name is Max"
3. Gray: "How old is he?"

Old AI might respond: "What kind of dog is Max?" *(Not addressing "How old is he?")*

**After:**
AI correctly responds to "How old is he?":
- "He just turned 3 last month"
- "3 years old and still acts like a puppy"
- "He's 3! Want to meet him sometime?"

---

### Problem 2: Not Matching User's Style

**Before:**
User has been texting short, casual: "yeah", "fr", "lol"
Old AI might generate: "I completely understand what you're saying, and I think that's quite interesting."

**After:**
AI matches user's style:
- "fr that's wild"
- "yeah im down"
- "lol same honestly"

---

### Problem 3: Missing Conversation Flow

**Before:**
Gray: "I'm so tired from work today"
Blue: "Same, what happened?"
Gray: "Just a crazy day with back to back meetings"

Old AI might say: "What do you do for work?" *(Ignoring that they just explained)*

**After:**
AI properly follows the flow:
- "That sounds exhausting, when do you finally get to relax?"
- "Back to back meetings are the worst, you deserve a drink"
- "Let me take you out this weekend so you can forget about work"

## Testing Checklist

When testing, verify the AI:

### Context Understanding
- [ ] Identifies which bubbles are the user's
- [ ] Identifies which bubbles are the other person's
- [ ] Responds to the LAST message from the other person
- [ ] Doesn't respond to the user's own messages

### Style Matching
- [ ] Matches user's message length
- [ ] Matches user's emoji usage
- [ ] Matches user's texting style (formal vs casual)
- [ ] Maintains user's established energy level

### Conversation Flow
- [ ] Directly addresses what was just said
- [ ] Builds on previous context
- [ ] Advances the conversation naturally
- [ ] Doesn't repeat or ignore information

## Example Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: iMessage Screenshot

**Input:**

```

**Expected Analysis:**
- User is responding to "I'm more of a hip hop person but I can vibe with that"
- User established casual tone with "Mostly indie and R&B, you?"

### Scenario 2: Dating App Screenshot

**Input:**
```
Left bubble: "Your travel photos are amazing! Where's your favorite place you've been?"
